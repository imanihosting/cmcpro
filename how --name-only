     made several important fixes to address the "Invalid Time Value" error and improve mobile responsiveness:
    In the TicketDetail component:
    Fixed the date handling by ensuring all timestamps are properly converted to Date objects
    Added a safe date formatting function to handle any potential invalid dates
    Improved mobile responsiveness with proper text wrapping (break-words)
    Added smaller padding on mobile and properly adjusted max widths
    Added margin to stacked elements for better small screen viewing
    In the API route:
    Modified the message timestamp to be stored as an ISO string for consistent date handling
    In the TicketList component:
    Improved mobile responsiveness with better spacing and flex wrapping
    Adjusted text sizes to be smaller on mobile screens
    Added proper spacing between stacked elements
    Made the subject text container better suited for smaller screens
    These changes should resolve the "Invalid Time Value" error by ensuring that:
    All timestamps are properly stored as ISO strings
    All date parsing is handled safely with proper error handling
    The UI gracefully handles any potential date formatting issues
    The mobile-first improvements ensure the UI is fully functional and visually appealing on small screens, with text that properly wraps and elements that stack cleanly when space is limited.
